# Create your own adventure

This set of tasks aims to help you practice basic Python concepts (variables, printing, user input, 
if-elif-else condition, list, for loop, dictionary, libraries).

For the tasks you will create a new python file in which you'll build your text adventure. 
In each step you will extend your file with the tasks exercises. Do not copy paste the code, 
just use it as a guide. Go back to the presentation examples to check the syntax and ask 
coaches for help when you get stuck ;) As a last resource, there's a file with a possible 
solution in the end of each task.
