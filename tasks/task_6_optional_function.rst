-----------------------------------------


Practice more functions. Use the code below.

A) Get creative write a function your_room. Check where it is called in the room.

    from sys import exit

    # start room
    def start():

        choice = input("There is a door to your right and left. Which one do you take? ")

        if choice == "left":
            bank_room()
        elif choice == "right":
            your_room()
        else:
            dead("You stumble around the room until you starve.")

    # second room
    def bank_room():

        choice = input("This room is full of money. How many bank note bundles do you take? ")

        if choice.isdigit():

            if int(choice) > 0 and int(choice) < 50:
                print("Nice, you're not greedy, you win!")
                exit(0)
            elif int(choice) > 50:
                dead("You greedy bastard!")

        else:
            dead("Man, learn to type a number.")

        print(why, "You are dead.")
        exit(0)

    start()
