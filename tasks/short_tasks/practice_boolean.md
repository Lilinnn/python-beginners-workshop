# Exercise 2: Boolean & Comparisons

This is the way how you write comments in Python:

~~~Python
# Hi! I'm Anna and I am living in coding.py.
# I'm an expert Python coder.
# I'm 51 years old and and I can teach myself Python.
~~~

Comments are useful for additional explanation of your code.

### Instructions:

**1.**
Someone has introduced themselves to you using comments in coding.py. (It is just a joke, you do not have to create a file coding.py, of course ;) )

Read the comments and then create a variable called `age_is_7` and set it to be `True` or `False` depending on if this person's age is 7.

**2.**
Create a variable called `name_is_anna` and set it to be `True` or `False` depending on if this person's name is Anna.

Of course, you can create more variables with `True` or `False`.

**3.**
Compare 2 variables with: **and**, **or**, **!=**, **==**.
