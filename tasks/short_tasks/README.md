# Exercise 1: Strings & Variables

1. Create a variable called `name` and assign your first name to that variable.
2. Print `"Welcome to the Dungeon, xxx!"`. Use **name** inside of your printing. Do not forget about **f** at the beginning
You can use double or single quotes. Both will work!

**Note:** xxx has to be replaced by your name! Do not forget the space behind *Dungeon,*.

### Expected Output:

If your name is Jane, then the output will look like this:

```
"Welcome to the Dungeon, Jane!"
```

# Exercise 2: Boolean & Comparisons

This is the way how you write comments in Python:

~~~Python
# Hi! I'm Anna and I am living in coding.py.
# I'm an expert Python coder.
# I'm 51 years old and and I can teach myself Python.
~~~

Comments are useful for additional explanation of your code.

### Instructions

**1.**
Someone has introduced themselves to you using comments in coding.py. (It is just a joke, you do not have to create a file coding.py, of course ;) )

Read the comments and then create a variable called `age_is_7` and set it to be `True` or `False` depending on if this person's age is 7.

**2.**
Create a variable called `name_is_anna` and set it to be `True` or `False` depending on if this person's name is Anna.

Of course, you can create more variables with `True` or `False`.
If you want, you can compare them with **and**, **or**, **!=**, **==**.

# Exercise 3: Conditions

Imagine that you are a teacher in school and you would like to automatize the calculation of grades.

### Instructions

1. Create a new variable `student_points` and give it a number between `100` and `0`.
2. Write first `if` condition that will say `student_points > 90`. If the condition is `True`, this will print `A`.
3. The second condition will start with the new word `elif` (= else if). This condition will say `student_points >= 80`. If the condition is `True`, this will print `B`. Ask coaches for a help.
4. And write `else` condition at the end that will print `C`.

**Note**: do not forget the 4 spaces after semicolon `:`, otherwise you will get `IndentationError`.

### Output

**Example:** The student Nicole got 82 point in the school test.

You can expect this result:

~~~Python
B
~~~

**Note**: there can be more grades, of course ;)
