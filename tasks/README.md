# Create your own adventure #

This set of tasks aims to help you practice basic python concepts (variables, printing, user input, 
if-elif-else condition, list, for loop, dictionary, libraries)

In the tasks you will create a text adventure in a python file. 
In each step you will extend your file with the tasks exercises. Read the description of each task
in each link in the docstring in the top. Do not copy paste the code, just use it as
a guide. Go back to the presentation examples to check the syntax and ask coaches for help
when you get stuck ;)
