# Exercise 3: Conditions

Imagine that you are a teacher in school and you would like to automatize the calculation of grades.

### Instructions:

1. Create a new variable `student_points` and give it a number between `100` and `0`.
2. Write first `if` condition that will say `student_points > 90`. If the condition is `True`, this will print `A`.
3. The second condition will start with the new word `elif` (= else if). This condition will say `student_points >= 80`. If the condition is `True`, this will print `B`. Ask coaches for a help.
4. And write `else` condition at the end that will print `C`.

**Note**: do not forget the 4 spaces after semicolon `:`, otherwise you will get `IndentationError`.

### Output:

**Example:** The student Nicole got 82 point in the school test.

You can expect this result:

~~~Python
B

**Note**: there can be more grades, of course ;)
